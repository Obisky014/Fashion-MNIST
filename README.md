# Fashion MNIST CNN Classifier

## Overview
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images from the **Fashion MNIST dataset**. The model is trained to recognize **10 different clothing categories**, such as shirts, sneakers, and dresses.

## Dataset
- **Fashion MNIST** consists of **70,000 grayscale images**, each **28x28 pixels**.
- The dataset includes **60,000 training images** and **10,000 test images**.

## Model Overview
- The model consists of **convolutional, pooling, and dense layers**.
- Uses **ReLU activation** for hidden layers and **Softmax activation** for classification.
- Optimized with **Adam** and trained with a categorical cross-entropy loss function.

## Results
- Achieved **high accuracy** on both training and test sets.
- Successfully predicted fashion categories with minimal overfitting.

## Next Steps
- Experiment with **Dropout layers** to improve generalization.
- Test on **custom fashion images**.
- Explore **data augmentation** for enhanced model robustness.
